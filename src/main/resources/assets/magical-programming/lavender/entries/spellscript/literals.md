As mentioned in the Literals and Functions chapter, literals are tokens that do not take arguments and return a value. This article contains all literals:

- self. Self will return the caster of the spell.
- Numbers. Any valid double number (including decimals and exponential notation) will be used as a number.

- Strings. Anything between two quotation marks is a string.
- Booleans. {red}true{} and {red}false{} are valid boolean literals.
- Null. {red}null{} is the null literal, representing nothing.
- Identifiers. Anything that isn't one of the other literal types is an identifier, which can represent variables.
This is just plain text outside of a string.

- Types. Put the type name in all caps. Valid types are listed in the types entry.
