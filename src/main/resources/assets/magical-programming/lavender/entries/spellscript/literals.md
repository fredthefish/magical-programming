As mentioned in the Literals and Functions chapter, literals are tokens that do not take arguments and return a value. This article contains all literals:

- self. Self will return the caster of the spell.
- Numbers. Any valid double number (including decimals and exponential notation) will be used as a number.

;;;;;

- Strings. Anything between two quotation marks is a string. A string can also store a quotation mark with the sequence \".
- Booleans. {red}true{} and {red}false{} are valid boolean literals.
- Variables. Once created with var(), variables can have their value gotten by simply typing their name (not in a string).

;;;;;

- Null. {red}null{} is the null literal, representing nothing.
- Types. Put the type name in all caps. Valid types are listed in the types entry.
