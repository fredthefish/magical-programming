As mentioned in the Literals and Functions chapter, literals are tokens that do not take arguments and return a value. This article contains all literals:

- self. Self will return the caster of the spell.
- Numbers. Any valid double number (including decimals and exponential notation) will be used as a number.

- Strings. Anything between two quotation marks is a string.
