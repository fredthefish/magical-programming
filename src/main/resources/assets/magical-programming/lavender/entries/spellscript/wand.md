In order to start, you will need a {light_purple}magic wand{}. Wands come at a steep price, but you will find that it is worth it.

Using wands is simple. You right-click to cast the spell written into it, and you sneak right-click to view or change the spell.
Spells are written in {light_purple}SpellScript{}, which will be explained later.
Spells require {light_purple}Mana{} to cast.
