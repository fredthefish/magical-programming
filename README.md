This mod adds in the magic wand item, where you can put in your spells in a custom programming language (SpellScript), and it'll run them! This allows you to do a lot of things.

To get the magic wand, craft with a nether star on top of two sticks. This may seem expensive, but it is definitely worth it. To use the wand, sneak right click to edit the spell, and right click to cast the spell.
